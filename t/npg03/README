Nagios-Plugin-Getopt-03.t automatically tests all cases defined in 
the 'input' directory and expects the output to match the 
corresponding file in the 'expected' directory. To define a new test 
case, just create a new file in the 'input' directory containing the 
input command line, and a corresponding file in the 'expected' 
directory containing what you think the expanded command line should 
be. Note that this expansion is normalised as follows:

- command line arguments are reported in alphabetical order
- extraneous white space is removed

Also, if you use a completely new argument than those currently 
defined in Nagios-Plugin-Getopt-03.t you will need to define it 
there as well.
